Objective:
Create a Python program that allows users to interactively manage a list of their favorite movies. 
The program should provide options to add a new movie, view all movies, save the movie list to a file, 
and load the movie list from a file.

Requirements:
Use functions to structure your code for adding a movie, displaying the movie list, saving the list to a file, and loading the list from a file.
Implement basic error handling for file operations.
Make the program interactive, with user input determining the actions (e.g., add a movie, view list, save, load).
Ensure the program is user-friendly with clear prompts and messages.
